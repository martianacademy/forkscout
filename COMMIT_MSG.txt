refactor: two-directory tool system, self-kill guard, think-then-stop retry, post-restart auto-continue

## Problems & Solutions

### 1. Token bloat from 34 tools injected at step 0
PROBLEM: All 34 tools lived in src/tools/ and were loaded into the LLM context
on every single request, wasting tokens and slowing responses. Most tools are
rarely used — only ~9 are needed on every message.

SOLUTION: Split tools into two auto-discovered directories:
- src/tools/ (9 bootstrap tools) — in git, injected at step 0
- .agents/tools/ (25 extended tools) — gitignored, runtime-managed
auto_discover_tools.ts now scans both directories. tsconfig.json includes
.agents/**/* for type-checking. On fresh clone only bootstrap tools exist.

### 2. Agent killed itself via shell command
PROBLEM: Agent ran 'pkill -9 -f bun' through run_shell_command_tools to restart
itself, bypassing validate_and_restart. Killed its own process (exit 137), new
instance failed on port 3200 (EADDRINUSE). Result: dead agent.

SOLUTION: Added self-kill guard to run_shell_command_tools — regex blocklist
catches pkill/killall/bun start/kill PID patterns. Returns BLOCKED error
directing the agent to use validate_and_restart instead.

### 3. Agent thinks then stops (blank response)
PROBLEM: Model (minimax-m2.5) produces a think block, reasoning middleware
strips it, leaving empty text. Agent returns static message — useless to user.

SOLUTION: Both runAgent() and streamAgent() now auto-retry on empty text:
- Injects a nudge message directing the model to respond
- Runs a second generateText call with original history + models reasoning
- Short leash: stopWhen stepCountIs(5) on retry
- Falls back to static message only if retry also fails

### 4. Agent forgets task after self-restart
PROBLEM: Agent restarts to apply code changes (via validate_and_restart), comes
back online, notifies owner, then sits idle. Previous task context is lost.

SOLUTION: Restart-context persistence system:
- validate_and_restart now accepts optional continue_task parameter
- Writes .agents/restart-context.json before spawning restart script
- On Telegram startup, reads the file and deletes it immediately
- If continueTask is set, fires a SELF-RESUME self-session after 3s delay
- Owner sees both the restart notification and the auto-continued result

### 5. Stale ai_agent_must_readme.md naming
PROBLEM: All folder documentation files were named ai_agent_must_readme.md —
non-standard, not recognized by GitHub/editors as folder docs.

SOLUTION: Renamed all 16 files to README.md. Updated identity.ts system prompt,
read_folder_standard_tools.ts, file-editing.md, and all cross-references.
Zero stale references remaining.
